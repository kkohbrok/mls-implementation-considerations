    The Messaging Layer Security (MLS) Implementation Considerations
         draft-kohbrok-mls-implementation-considerations-latest

Abstract

   The MLS protocol is a large and complex security protocol.  In this
   document, we provide guidance and recommendations for implementers of
   MLS regarding correctness, security, efficiency and robustness.

1.  Introduction

   Implementing the specification of a complex security protocol in a
   correct and secure manner is a challenging task.

   This document aims to provide guidance to implementers of the
   Messaging Layer Security (MLS) protocol specification
   [I-D.ietf-mls-protocol] in a variety of ways.

   The goal of this document is also to extend the existing guidance
   given in the MLS architecture document [I-D.ietf-mls-architecture] on
   how to use MLS securely in a larger context.

   Finally, this document is also meant to provide examples on how to
   fill several of the gaps that the protocol specification and
   architective document have left open, but that are likely going to be
   needed by a large number of MLS users.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
